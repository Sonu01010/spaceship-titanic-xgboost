# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic - XGBoost Classifier (Kaggle ML Project)

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition using an XGBoost classifier.

## 🧠 Overview
The goal was to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension using the given spaceship passenger dataset.

## 📈 Model Used
- ✅ XGBoost Classifier
- ✅ Validation Accuracy: **0.7952**
- ✅ No hyperparameter tuning (baseline model)

## 🔧 Preprocessing
- Label Encoding for categorical features
- Median imputation for missing values
- Standard Scaling for numerical features

## 📁 Files Included
- `spaceship_model.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook with full code  
- `submission.csv` → Final prediction file submitted to Kaggle  
- *(Note: train/test datasets not included as per Kaggle rules)*
